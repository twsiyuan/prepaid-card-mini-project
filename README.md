# Prepaid Card Mini Project

A simple test project, implemented backend using golang, frontend using javascript with JQuery for quick implementation.

## Issues
- Need automatic tests
- Queries will be slow when cards and transactions increasing
- Security needs to be improved, add SSL and virtual card id mechanism
- IDs should be random (may use UUID.v4) to avoid information attack
